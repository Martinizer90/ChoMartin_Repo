In this project, I am focusing on the development of content creation development tool. This tool is specifically created for beginners to demonstrate the basic scripting and mesh object of each player, items, and hazard volume objects, which users can modify easily for brainstorming prototype.
Package including basic meshes for simple spaceship game development. That including base player object with fully working controls, item which players can pick up and speed up the spaceship, and hazard volume where player take damages.
Currently scripting and model shape for spaceship, power up item and hazard volume is complete, but will include additional features such as player health bar, enemy navigation system and simple main menu screen which also can modify by the consumers.
